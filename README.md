## Short description

This project is the solution for the Zulu Challenge. It can register new clients, login, create a wallet and update balances.

To run it:

- docker-compose up
- npm run start

## Tasks

- Can register a client
- Can login
- Can create a wallet
- Can update balances from a wallet

## Tests

At the beginning I try to add tests for everything but when I noticed that it will take me more time than I had, I quit for doing it.
But there are some unit tests to check the quality. Also, I didn't make integration tests because the time.
_The project contains a github file to run code coverage._

## Missing for time

- Deploy in heroku :(
- I tried to make like Pull Requests for each commit but I only did that at the beginning
